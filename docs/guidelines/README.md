# Joomla Accessibility Guidelines
## What is this?
We want to create a set of simple accessibility guidelines, for designers of Joomla-based websites and for developers of extensions and templates. 

## Get involved
You can also help. The Joomla Accessible Team needs your time and talent.
Authors, editors, correctionists, documentalists - anyone can help. 
Joomla means "all together". Together we will achieve our goal more quickly. 

Create new guidelines. Suggest changes. Correct errors. Develop a better version of an existing function. Add illustrations, examples. Report a fault. Suggest new topics.

Join us [Join us on  Volunteers Portal](https://volunteers.joomla.org/teams/accessibility-team) and create these guides with us.
