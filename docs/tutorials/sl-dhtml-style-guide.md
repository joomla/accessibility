# DHTML Style Guide Working Group

 The DHTML Style Guide Working Group (DSGWG) has come together to create a recommendation for keyboard shortcuts, to be used in website widgets. Group task is to recommend the best, most intuitive, most international friendly shortcut keys possible without regard to their current use.

 The DSGWG can be used as a guide, for designers and developers. They can be treated as an alternative to the guidelines, contained in WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1.
