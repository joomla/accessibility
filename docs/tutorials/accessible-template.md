## Introduction
The template is a key extension of the Joomla core. It supports the presentation of page content. It decides about all aspects of the appearance of pages on the site - about the organization of each page, layout and placement of content, color palette, typography and other properties. Each of these aspects of the template has a significant impact on the accessibility of websites. 

The purpose of this entry is to present the requirements and guidelines for building frontend and backend templates for Joomla. I won't tell you how to build templates at all. This is a topic for another tutorial. 

We will focus only on those aspects of the template that may determine the accessibility of the websites content.   

## Responsive design
Responsive design is the basis of design for all, for inclusive design.

## Logical and semantic structure
...
## All content in the designated regions
...
## Labeling regions
...
## Effective navigation (skip links)
..
## Provide accessible color schema
When can colors cause accessibility problems? More often than you think. 

When you are in a dark room, bright colours on the screen will be unpleasant for you, they will quickly make your eyesight tired and make browsing and reading more difficult. 

When using your smartphone or tablet in the sun, reflections of light from bright backgrounds can make you unable to browse the web at all. 

And these are just extreme situations. 

Nearly 50% of the world's population wears corrective glasses for various reasons.  Half of the population! 
940 million people

If you want them to love your designs, make sure that they are not only beautiful, unique, but above all easy to browse and read, well contrasted. 

What does "well contrasted" mean?

## Perceptible typography

## Accessible widgets
