# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0][1] is a technical standard designed by the W3C to show how to make web content that is accessible to people with disabilities. It has **12 guidelines** that are organized under **4 principles**. Each guideline has testable **success criteria**, each of which has an associated level: **A**, **AA** or **AAA**.


## Design principles
WCAG 2.0 is based around four design principles that state that, in order for a website to be accessible, it must have content that is: 

* [**Principle 1: Perceivable**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#principle1). Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
* [**Principle 2: Operable**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#principle2). User interface components and navigation must be operable.
* [**Principle 3: Understandable**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#principle3). Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
* [**Principle 4: Robust**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#principle4). Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.


## Guidelines

Each design principle has a number of guidelines associated with it. There are 12 guidelines in total.


### Perceivable: 

   [**1.1 Text alternatives**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#text-equiv): Provide text alternatives for non-text content.

   [**1.2 Time-based Media**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#media-equiv): Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia.

   [**1.3 Adaptable**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#content-structure-separation):Create content that can be presented in different ways, including by assistive technologies, without losing meaning.

   [**1.4 Distinguishable**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast): Make it easier for users to see and hear content.


### Operable:

   [**2.1 Keyboard Accessible**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#keyboard-operation): Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

   [**2.2 Enough Time**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#time-limits): Give users enough time to read and use content.

   [**2.3 Seizures**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#seizure): Do not use content that causes seizures.

   [**2.4 Navigable**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#navigation-mechanisms): Help users navigate and find content.

### Understandable:

   [**3.1 Readable**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#meaning): Make text readable and understandable.

   [**3.2 Predictable**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#consistent-behavior): Make content appear and operate in predictable ways.

   [**3.3 Input assistance**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#minimize-error): Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

### Robust: 

   [**4.1 Compatible**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#ensure-compat): Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools.


## Success criteria 
Each of the guidelines has a number of associated success criteria.

For example, Guideline 2.4, which focuses on Navigable, has ten success criteria. Success Criteria 2.4.2 states, “Page Titled: Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose. (Level A)”.

## Conformance Level
One of the following levels of conformance is met in full.

   **Level A**: For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the Web page satisfies all the Level A Success Criteria, or a conforming alternate version is provided.

   **Level AA**: For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.

   **Level AAA**: For Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.
