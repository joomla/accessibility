# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0][1] is a technical standard designed by the W3C to show how to make web content that is accessible to people with disabilities. It has **12 guidelines** that are organized under **4 principles**. Each guideline has testable **success criteria**, each of which has an associated level: **A**, **AA** or **AAA**.


## Design principles
WCAG 2.0 is based around four design principles that state that, in order for a website to be accessible, it must have content that is: 

* **Principle 1: Perceivable**. Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
* **Principle 2: Operable**. User interface components and navigation must be operable.
* **Principle 3: Understandable**. Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
* **Principle 4: Robust**. Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.


## Guidelines

Each design principle has a number of guidelines associated with it. There are 12 guidelines in total.


### Perceivable: 

   **1.1 Text alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for non-text content.

   **1.2 Time-based Media**: Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia.

   **1.3 Adaptable**:Create content that can be presented in different ways, including by assistive technologies, without losing meaning.

   **1.4 Distinguishable**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content.


### Operable:

   **2.1 Keyboard Accessible**: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

   **2.2 Enough Time**: Give users enough time to read and use content.

   **2.3 Seizures**: Do not use content that causes seizures.

   **2.4 Navigable**: Help users navigate and find content.

### Understandable:

   **3.1 Readable**: Make text readable and understandable.

   **3.2 Predictable**: Make content appear and operate in predictable ways.

   **3.3 Input assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

### Robust: 

   **4.1 Compatible**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools.


## Success criteria 
Each of the guidelines has a number of associated success criteria.

For example, Guideline 2.4, which focuses on Navigable, has ten success criteria. Success Criteria 2.4.2 states, “Page Titled: Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose. (Level A)”.

## Conformance Level
One of the following levels of conformance is met in full.

   **Level A**: For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the Web page satisfies all the Level A Success Criteria, or a conforming alternate version is provided.

   **Level AA**: For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.

   **Level AAA**: For Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.
