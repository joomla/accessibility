# How to test the accessibility of an extension
We want to create a simple tutorial that will convince site designers to check the accessibility of Joomla extensions used in websites and explain to them how to check accessibility.

**You also can help.** Write down your proposals, comment on others' proposals, write down a different approach than the one already proposed.
This should be a few key tests (e.g. five)

## Introduction
Website designers somtetimes ask me how to evaluate an extension and template for accessibility without being an expert.
If the sites were made by accessibility experts, they would propably not ask such question.

It's not unusual that you're not an accessibility expert. But it's great that you think about accessibility when designing your website.
It's great that before you decide to use an extension or template, you want to evaluate its accessibility.

If you know that accessibility is important, if you know that accessibility must be thought about at all stages of the website creation process, then you will certainly build an accessible website. 
Maybe it will not be perfect, maybe there will be some faults in it, but surely there will be no such errors on it that people with disabilities will avoid your website from afar.

The most common source of inaccessibility of websites is ignorance of their creators - programmers, webmasters, authors.

Therefore, if you ask yourself questions about accessibility, you are on the right track to ensure accessibility. 
Where there's a will there's a way.
