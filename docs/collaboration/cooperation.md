This documentation is for the use of volunteers, working in the Joomla Accessibility Team and constitutes a set of guidelines, with a view to minimizing confusion, ambiguity, duplication and arguments, during the process of developing a variety of accessibility features into the Joomla! 4.0 version of the CMS. It is supplied as a set of RFC documents.

***The RFC documentation methodology:***

As a standard method of documenting new features, standards and rules, for a project, as a first step in its development, organisations such as the World Wide Web Consortium, use a system known as RFC. That stands for 'Request For Comments'.

The idea is that the initial instigator begins a version of an RFC document and it is distributed to all that may have concerns with the issue. They, then, have the opportunity to comment on the contents of the document and contribute to the next version of it. The comments may be in the form of questions, statements of fact, opinions etc.

Based upon the original version and the incoming comments, a new version is then prepared and also distributed, in the same way. This process is repeated until all comments that are considered important, are dealt with and an agreement is requested to finalize the document.
I am writing this document, as an RFC and the header reflects that and, also, contains the version number, the name of the instigator and date.

N.B. Not all of our documentation follows the RFC methodology.
